    "### 📝 Questions for Reflection  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **How is prompt chaining similar to solving a jigsaw puzzle?**  \n",
    "👉 Solving a jigsaw puzzle requires placing pieces one by one until the full picture is revealed. Similarly, prompt chaining breaks a complex task into smaller steps, where each prompt’s output acts like a puzzle piece that guides the next step, eventually leading to the complete solution.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **What’s the main difference between iteration and chaining?**  \n",
    "👉 **Iteration** involves refining the *same* prompt multiple times with small tweaks until the output is satisfactory.  \n",
    "👉 **Chaining** involves using a *sequence of different prompts*, where each one builds on the result of the previous step to accomplish a larger, multi-stage task.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Why might prompt chaining be more effective than asking AI one big question?**  \n",
    "👉 Breaking a complex request into smaller, focused prompts helps the AI remain accurate, reduces confusion, and gives you more control over each step. This usually produces clearer, more structured, and higher-quality results compared to asking one long, overloaded question.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **How can the context window of an AI model affect your chaining strategy?**  \n",
    "👉 The **context window** is the maximum amount of text the AI can “see” and remember at once.  \n",
    "- If the context window is **large**, the AI can retain more of the earlier steps, making chaining smoother.  \n",
    "- If the context window is **small**, you may need to summarize or carry forward only the most important outputs, so the AI doesn’t lose track of essential information.  \n"
